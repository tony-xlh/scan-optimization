Size optimization of scanned documents.

There are several factors related to the size of scanned documents:

1. Scanning DPI.
2. Color Depth.
3. Image Compression.

This repo contains samples demonstrating how the factors affect the size on documents scanned with [Dynamic Web TWAIN](https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/overview).

* [DPI.html](https://tony-xlh.github.io/scan-optimization/DPI.html). Demonstrate how DPI affects the size.
* [ColorQuantization.html](https://tony-xlh.github.io/scan-optimization/ColorQuantization.html). Demonstrate how color depth affects the size.
* [Formats.html](https://tony-xlh.github.io/scan-optimization/Formats.html). Demonstrate how image format (compression) affects the size.
* [Multipage.html](https://tony-xlh.github.io/scan-optimization/Multipage.html). Demonstrate the compression rate of a multi-page PDF file or a multi-page TIFF file produced by Dynamic Web TWAIN.

There is also a [calculator](https://tony-xlh.github.io/scan-optimization/Calculator.html) which calculates the image size based on its width, height, and bitdepth.
